# Cyber-Security-Project
This project uses supervised machine learning to detect phishing websites based on URL structure and pattern features. By leveraging techniques like SMOTE oversampling, class weighting, and threshold tuning, the model achieves 96.6% recall, making it highly effective for cybersecurity applications where missing phishing attempts is costly.
